COMP 150 Mobile Development - Tiny App Project

Overview: This is my first project using Android Developer Studio. The purpose of the app is to evoke humor through pictures of cute puppies. This tiny app allows users to interact with the interface as if they have a stake in their journey through the app. However, the app only has one possible path that they user can take.

Usage: The app starts with an image of a bulldog, a text box, and a button widget. The user must answer the question by pressing a button. This take them to a second view that shows them if the answer was correct. This landing page marks the end of the path, so there is a rating of the app out of 5 stars that the user can mark. For further development of the app, the ratings should be stored in a database to be used for analysis. There should also be a collection of photos and the app should randomly select one so that the user can go on the app more than once. 

Running Requirements: Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)

Documentation and resourcse used: Android Developer
